}

\item{n}{Number of non-breaking spaces to use as indentation. If \code{n = 0} then
no indentation is performed.}

\description{
\code{\link[=indent]{indent()}} prefixes a string with a sequence of HTML non-breaking spaces,
to effectively work as indentation.
}
\examples{
# Default is to indent by four non-breaking spaces.
indent("Mean")

# Choose a different indentation level.
indent("Mean", n = 2L)

# `indent()` is vectorised over `x`
