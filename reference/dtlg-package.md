# dtlg: A Performance-Focused Package for Clinical Trial Tables

Create high-performance clinical reporting tables (TLGs) from ADaM-like
inputs. The package provides a consistent, programmatic API to generate
common tables such as demographics, adverse event incidence, and
laboratory summaries, using 'data.table' for fast aggregation over large
populations. Functions support flexible target-variable selection,
stratification by treatment, and customizable summary statistics, and
return tidy, machine-readable results ready to render with downstream
table/formatting packages in analysis pipelines.
